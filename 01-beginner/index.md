This is the first part of the *Introduction to research programming with Python* course.

This course teaches the basics of programming using Python with the focus to use
it for research. It’s aimed at researchers that have no experience of
programming – in any language - before. If you're already comfortable, with
variables, loops, and functions; then this course is not for you.

### This session will cover:

1. Fundamental Python language syntax
2. The different ways to use Python
3. Data structures with lists and dictionaries
4. Repeating actions and making choices
5. Files and the filesystem
6. Making functions
7. Basic data visualisation
    
### By the end of this course you will be able to:

1. Use Python from different interfaces
2. Write your own programs that will allow you to repeat an experiment
3. Create functions to be able to reuse it from different programs
4. Read and write data files from a program
5. Visualise your data
6. Understand other programming languages

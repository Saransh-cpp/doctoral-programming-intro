title: An introduction to programming for research using Python
---

# {{ page.title }}

In this course, we will introduce programming for researchers who handle data.

This is **not** an advanced course. The fundamental ideas of programming will
be introduced for the first time.

However, **it is a course for graduate students** -- the content will be covered
sufficiently fast that we can reach a point where
you will be able to apply this knowledge to your
research at the end of the course, and we will not try to hide away the
niggling details that you will encounter in real programming.

## Topics Covered

This course is broken into two sub-courses:

* [Part I](01-beginner/)
  - Fundamental Python language syntax
  - The IPython Notebook
  - Data structures with lists and dictionaries
  - Files and the filesystem
  - Data visualisation

* [Part II](02-novice/)
  - Parsing CSV data
  - JSON and YAML
  - Getting data from the internet
  - Introducing Matplotlib
  - Introducing NumPy
  - Creating packages

## Alternatives

If you're already comfortable, with variables, loops, and functions, this course is not for you!
You should join us instead for [MPHY0021: Research Software Engineering with Python](http://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/rsd-engineeringcourse/)

# What you need for the course

## Desktop@UCL or UCL Cluster Rooms

* Log in with your UCL Userid and password
* Using the start menu, type "jupyter"
* Choose "Jupyter Lab"
* A browser should open showing the Jupyter Lab interface

## On your own machine

If you can, we recommend using your own laptop to follow these notes, as the tools will
then be ready for use in your research.

You can follow the [Jupyter installation instructions](https://jupyter.org/install.html).
Of the available options, we recommend the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution which
includes Jupyter and all the scientific python ecosystem that we will use. Choose the Python 3.8 option and
[follow the instructions on the Anaconda site](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

## Downloading the materials

You will want to download the [Jupyter Notebooks for this course](notebooks.zip), and unzip them into
an appropriate folder, so you can find them when you launch the notebook. 
Alternatively, you can download each session from the download button on the top right corner.

## PDF Handout

You will also find the lecture notes useful in [printable format](notes.pdf)

# Following this course

## Self-supported Learning

You can follow this course at your own pace at any time. If you need help, please contact
RC-softdev@ucl.ac.uk and we will try to help you, though if you need a lot of help, you'll
be better off coming to an organised instance.

## Supervised Learning

We regularly run face-to-face (either in person or online) instances of this course.

These course takes, in part, a "flipped classroom" approach to teaching:

In the olden days, before the internet, lectures were a "broadcast" medium: a way of getting
information from the lecturer's notebook into students' notebooks.

Work inside the classroom was used for sharing theory, and homework outside the classroom was used for exercises.

In a world with an internet, this makes less sense.

We have provided online notes to cover the materials you need to know, and you can study these in your own time.

Class time can then be used as a forum, to discuss confusing aspects of the materials, work on exercises
with help from experienced teachers.

To learn more about the flipped classroom, see the [keynote by Lorena Barba at SciPy 2014](https://youtu.be/TWxwKDT88GU?t=669).

## Supplementary materials

In the past, lecture notes have been treated as a standalone textbook, assuming students need to be able to learn
(and pass exams) without access to any other materials. In a world with an internet, this is clearly wrong.
This course recognises that you *will* be googling for supplementary learning materials, and encourages that.
The problem is that the internet is full of materials of varying quality, and attempting to absorb it all
can leave learners even more confused.

Thus, good lecture notes should act as a scaffold or backbone to external materials: offering links to
the best of the web, and ordering and structuring these. We've therefore often added links to
other notes on the web.

# Guidance to Teachers

If you find these notes on the internet, and want to teach them yourself, feel free to do so.

We don't provide slides; the assumption is you will use the Jupyter notebooks directly on the projector.
We find students *believe us more* when they see code executed on-the-fly.
